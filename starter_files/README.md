# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project consists of two phases :  using Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. This part is mainly done by using the Azure ML studio and the Terminal (GitBash). The second phase involves creating, publishing, and consuming a pipeline using the Python SDK and Jupyter Notebook. In both phases we work with the [Bank Marketing dataset](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv). The goal is to predict whether bank customers subscribe to term deposits (target variable y=1) or not (target variable y=0) based on the values of input variables (age, job, marital, education, etc).

The main steps followed in the project are :

1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging
5. Swagger Documentation
6. Consume model endpoints
7. Create and publish a pipeline
8. Documentation

We didn't include the Autentication step because we are using the lab Udacity provided to you, you can skip this step since you are not authorized to create a security principal.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
