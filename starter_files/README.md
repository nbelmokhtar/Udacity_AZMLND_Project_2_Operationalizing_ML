# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project consists of two phases :  using Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. The second phase involves creating, publishing, and consuming a pipeline. In both phases we work with the [Bank Marketing dataset](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv). The goal is to predict whether bank customers subscribe to term deposits (target variable y=1) or not (target variable y=0) based on the values of input variables (age, job, marital, education, etc).

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
